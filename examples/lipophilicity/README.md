# Example Applied to Lipophilicty Dataset
Lipophilicity is an important feature of drug molecules that affects both membrane permeability and solubility. 
This dataset contains a list of 4,200 molecules curated from ChEMBL along with their experimental octanol/water distribution coefficient (i.e., logD at pH 7.4). 
It was compiled by Wu, Z. et al. MoleculeNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning. Chem. Sci. 2018, 9, 513âˆ’530.
